    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company that hosts a popular game, Draw It or Lose It, that they wish to move to a web-based application that will reach more users. The game is based off of popular game show Win, Lose, or Draw. They wanted a budget friendly solution to expanding their product.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did well in understanding the needs of the client. The Gaming Room wanted to turn their game into a web-based application, which is fairly lightweight. By utilizing cloud infrastructure, they can keep their product adaptable and scalable as demand for it continues to grow, while keeping costs cheap. They only need to provide the code for the program and images to accompany it.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document is like creating a guide for what the program needs to incorporate. It provides knowledge for what kind of systems you will be developing for, and which strategies and designs that will need to be employed to meet the performance requirements of the hardware.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the recommendations section. While I am satisfied and confident in my recommendations for the client, I feel that there is room for more detail and background as to why these recommendations were chosen. Listing out technical specifications for justification would help.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The Gaming Room needed a web-based application that would meet specific performance requirements to draw in more users. Taking this concept allowed me to research low cost, yet effective solutions that would meet their needs. Creating a list of each hardware specification helps to refine and detail the recommendations. Keeping the user's needs in mind when designing is important because, after all, they are the ones using the product. If it's not accessible or intuitive, users will not use it.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Taking more time to interview the client and learn more about what they expect from the end product would allow for better recommendations and analysis. Listing functional and non-functional requirements, and iterating repeatedly are two strategies for the initial phase of planning the design document that help with the later stages.
